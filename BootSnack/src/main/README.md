## Project Goals 

1. Firstly I knew it was going to be a battle to just meet all the required CRUD task being so new to spring boot/
2. I wanted to stretch my abilities with HTML and CSS on my own. Added styling and background. 
3. Build a really clean looking interface and try to maintan organized code. 

## Lessons Learned
@@ I need to review bootstrap procedures to my projects. I tried but couldnt get it to work so I went way old school with CSS and HTML styling within the sheets themselves. @@
@@ Not the ideal way but it turned out really nice. I had to do so much refactoring due to debugging and getting it all to work. Im addition I need a better understanding @@
@@ of JPA and Springboot in general. There is a lot that I dont understand and it still seems like magic. I did add background to my pages finally plus the styling. @@
